#Abis Wolfram Solver

##A free wolfram full results and step by step api resolver.

Fully frontend no suspicous proxy like the other repo [here](https://github.com/WolfreeAlpha)

This program is completely rebuilt with a reformed UI and is a fully single page application.

Since I removed the CORS Proxy by using jQuery's AJAX the requests to the api return faster and there is no worry of you cookies being stolen or your IP being logged. All trafic is either going from or into your computer. Execpt github pages hosting the site.

All javascript is perfusly documented and unobuscated so you can look through it to verify theres no funny buisness. Except the css it is minified.

Albiet I still give credit to the original creator for the API keys. Since one key only allows 2000 api calls a month, I am using the ones from the original repo.
